<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of the website is to promote the company and to increase the participation in the cosplay parties.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The success and failure of the website will be determined by the number of purchases made as a result of the site.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The site will be targeted to both anime and gaming fans predominately. Because of this it is better to make the site easy to navigate and physically appealing with a light color scheme. Since anime generally very bright and flashy a light and colorful scheme will seem more comfortable for the visitor. </p>
